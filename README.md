Hello! This is my MESBG Probability Calculator version 1.0.0.

Last updated: 4/2/2023

All rights reserved. For personal use only.

So, this calculator contains next items: The python calculator in the backend,
and also a www-GUI where an user can give inputs for the calculator.

Be reassured that, even though this calculator may seem simple outside, it is actually extremely
complex probability mathematics inside of it, and there are up to hundreds of loops to get a resolt.

The www-site will allow users to give 3 inputs for both combatants, so overall 6 inputs.
The inputs are: amount of dices, fighting value and a boolean for an elven sword.

I hope you will enjoy of my this project!
