Hello! This is my MESBG Probability Calculator version 1.0.0.

So, this calculator contains next items: A python 3 based calculator in the backend,
a javascript file as an intermediate point, and an HTML website for graphic user interface.

Be reassured that, even though this calculator may seem simple outside, it is actually extremely
complex probability mathematics inside of it, and there are up to hundreds of loops to get a resolt.

The www-site will allow users to give 3 inputs for both combatants, so overall 6 inputs.
The inputs are: amount of dices, fighting value and a boolean for an elven sword.

I hope you will enjoy this project!
